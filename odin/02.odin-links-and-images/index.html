    <p>The common way to link a page, which takes the <code>_self</code> value and opens the link in the current tab.</p>

    <p>Opening links in a new tab:</p>
    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About the Odin Project</a>

    <p>The <code>rel="noopener noreferrer"</code> is used for security reasons.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>"noopener"</code> means the opened
            link will not have access to change the page
            (this is known as tabnabbing, and most recent browsers are secured against
            this by default, as they always include <code>"noopener"</code> implicitly
            when <code>target="_blank"</code> is used).
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>"noreferrer"</code> means the opened link will not know which is the Referrer, i.e.,
            which website was the previous.</p>
