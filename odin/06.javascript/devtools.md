## Assignment

1. Head to the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome DevTools Documentation</a> by Google. The following subsections cover what you’ll be using the Developer Tools for 95% of the time.  Feel free to skip the elements you are already familiar with, and only read these:

  * JavaScript
    - <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Debug JavaScript</a> - Warning: In point 4 of step 3 of the tutorial, devtools will pause on the second line (<code>if (inputsAreEmpty()) {</code>) rather than at the declaration of the function. Don’t worry, this is expected.
