# Flexbox

Flexbox is a way to arrange items into rows or columns. These items will flex based on some rules that you can define.

It is not just a single CSS property but a whole toolbox of properties

Some of these properties belong on the flex container, while some go on the flex items.

A flex container is any element that has `display: flex` on it. A flex item is any element that lives directly inside of a flex container.
