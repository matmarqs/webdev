### [When is it safe to use new features?](#when-is-it-safe-to-use-new-features)

As exciting as it is to implement new features, there is a risk of rushing. It would not be a positive experience for your users to find that, for example, your application used to work well in Firefox, but due to changes in the codebase it is now unusable in Firefox but works well in Safari. Thankfully, there is a tool that can help you prevent this situation.

[“Can I Use”](https://caniuse.com/) is a great resource to help you validate if new features are supported by browsers. It provides statistics on which browsers and platforms are supporting new technologies, and even which versions of those browsers support specific features.

It is generally good advice to implement new features when they are supported by most common browsers. This way you’re less likely to encounter an issue that a lot of users will face.
